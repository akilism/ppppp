                He first took us to 12 chairs. One of the best new restaurants in the neighborhood and right next door to the office. 
                It’s run by some badass Israelis - we talked to the owner and got his story.
                He ordered us some hummus and falafel. It was awesome but Ben was extremely rude to the staff.
                Ben was being a total jerk, but thank goodness 12 Chairs has some incredible mint lemonade to calm us down.
